This is the official Toggle Toolkit repository.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contains:

-- toggleScript (universal one)


-- triggerScripts (many variations)

-- pathScript (data logging, to be potentially used elsewhere)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description (basic):

The toolkit enables researchers in different fields to design, conduct and evaluate experiments and include interactive elements immersive virtual environments. This was achieved by using the internal functionalities of the Unity engine as well as solutions of our own design. The structure of Toggle Toolkit allows triggers and toggles to be allocated to existing virtual objects and throughout the Unity scene. Once a trigger is executed (with a pre-described action, such as colliding with a virtual object, pressing a key, gazing at an object, etc.), the toggles associated with the trigger are activated and then change the attributes or behaviors of linked objects. All interactive behavior is logged and made available for further statistical analysis.

Furthermore, all C# scripts were properly documented (headers, code body).
